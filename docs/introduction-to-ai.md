## What is *Artificial Intelligence*?

## Historical Perspective

Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts gave the kick off to this young science in 1943 thanks to their work in which they proposed the first model of artificial neural network.

AI was not widely recognized, until 1950, when Alan Turing published his article *Computing machinery and intelligence*. Years later, Turing would co-author the first program capable of playing chess.

## Present and Future

Currently, there are many universities that do research in this field, but more and more companies like Google, governments and other institutions invest large amounts of money. Part of the reason why this happens lies on the internet, whose large amount of information facilitates access to large amounts of analysable data and at the same time demands new techniques to handle such quantities of information.
