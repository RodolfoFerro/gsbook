# Introduction to AI

This chapter aims to introduce AI as the concept itself, its context along history and what it is now.

## What is *Artificial Intelligence*?

At this moment in time, Artificial Intelligence doesn't have an exact description, even when is a field with a relative long history. The main problem when defining Artificial Intelligence is that it implies that there is a Natural Ingelligence, so, when talking about humans we can think we have this chracteristic because we can manipulate our reality, but animals can do that too, in a different and more passive way, but they do.
That's a question we have to keep wondering about, because there is no exact answer.

One person that kept it simple, was Alan Turing, who proposed : The Turing Test. This would allow us to decide if a computer is intelligent. 
The test consist on having a human talk to an entity on another room, the entity can be other human or a machine. If the person making the test can not differenciate if is having a conversation with a human when talking with the machine, then we can conclude the machine has artificial intelligence.

The machine that is intelligent must have the abilities to recognize the way a human talks, learn through time and be able to represent abstract concepts.But most importantly, it must be able to adapt itself to its enviroment.
How can a computer learn? The answer is that it has to be able to store information, retrieve it and give a meaning to it, label it, understand what it refers to.

There are other scientist and engineers that claim true artificial intelligence is when a computer is rational. But this gives the idea of the computer being eficient, not human like. We, as humans (if you're not a scrapper), are not necesarily rational or logical, and understanding consciusness is still far from our knowledge. In any case, this paradigm focus in creating **agents** that make decisions based on limited time and knowledge, with a very human caracteristic: collaboration, these are called **multiagent systems**.

At the end, what ever algorithm we choose to implement artificial intelligence, we take human behaviour and try to emulate it.


## Historical Perspective

Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts gave the kick off to this young science in 1943 thanks to their work in which they proposed the first model of artificial neural network.

AI was not widely recognized, until 1950, when Alan Turing published his article *Computing machinery and intelligence*. Years later, Turing would co-author the first program capable of playing chess.

`TODO.`

## Present and Future

Currently, there are many universities that do research in this field, but more and more companies like Google, governments and other institutions invest large amounts of money. Part of the reason why this happens lies on the internet, whose large amount of information facilitates access to large amounts of analysable data and at the same time demands new techniques to handle such quantities of information.
