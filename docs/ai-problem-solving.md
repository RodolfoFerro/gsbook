# AI and Problem Solving

AI at first may seem as magic, or an enigmatic thing, but that's far from reality. Artificial Intelligence is a tool that help us solve problems.

For the purposes of this summary, we will use the concept of problem to be: "Difficult task to solve".

Some problems we may have in our daily life such as how much time we need to travel from point A to point B, or how many bills we need to pay certain cost; to solve those problems our brains tend to break the problem into little pieces, so they're easier to understand and solve. Even when the situations may seem simple, we follow a process of simplification in order to achieve a goal.

## What we need when solving a *problem*:
**Model** -> Simplification of the real model. How the variables in our enviroment are connected.
**Objective** -> How we know we've reached a goal. What we can achieve.
**Evaluation Function** -> How good our solution is.

**Notes when solving the problem**
The solution we get at the end, is the solution for our model, not the real problem, that's why we need to be as descriptive as posible when building a model, so it can have a better adjustment in the real problem.
