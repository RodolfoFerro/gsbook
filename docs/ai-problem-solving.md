# AI and Problem Solving

AI at first may seem as magic, or an enigmatic thing, but that's far from reality. Artificial Intelligence is a tool that help us solve problems.

For the purposes of this summary, we will use the concept of problem to be: "Difficult task to solve".

Some problems we may have in our daily life such as how much time we need to travel from point A to point B, or how many bills we need to pay certain cost; to solve those problems our brains tend to break the problem into little pieces, so they're easier to understand and solve. Even when the situations may seem simple, we follow a process of simplification in order to achieve a goal.

## What we need when solving a *problem*:
**Model** -> Simplification of the real model. How the variables in our enviroment are connected.
**Objective** -> How we know we've reached a goal. What we can achieve.
**Evaluation Function** -> How good our solution is.

**Notes when solving the problem**
The solution we get at the end, is the solution for our model, not the real problem, that's why we need to be as descriptive as posible when building a model, so it can have a better adjustment to the real problem. 

### Some problems
**Traveling Salesman Problem**
Suppose we have a person (or object) that has to travel to different cities, visit all of them, and then return to the original starting point, no city can be repeated, but the path it follows must be the shortest possible.
To solve this problem with a few cities we can even solve it ourselves, but as we increase the number of cities and/or constraints, the most difficult is to get to an ideal solution. That's where AI comes in.
Time to solve the problem is the most difficult constraint.
